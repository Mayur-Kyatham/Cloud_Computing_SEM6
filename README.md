This project focuses on developing a web app or using an existing app, making use 
of atleast two cloud services and deploying it to the cloud. Here we are using “Joomla”. 
Joomla is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing 
web content on websites. It helps you build powerful dynamic websites and 
applications. It has an intuitive interface that helps you use its features and 
functionality to the fullest. We have made a simple website on JOOMLA. 

Cloud Services Used: 
1. Elastic Beanstalk 
2. RDS 
3. EC2 

We have used Elastic Beanstalk. With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy, 
manage, and scale applications without the operational burden of managing 
infrastructure. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity for web 
applications, making it a good choice for organizations that are new to AWS or wish 
to deploy a web application as quickly as possible. 
RDS is a managed relational database service that provides you six familiar database 
engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft 
SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. This means that the code, applications, and tools you 
already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS. 
Amazon RDS handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, 
recovery, failure detection, and repair. 
Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, 
so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch 
as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and 
manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in 
requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
